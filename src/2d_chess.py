Chess GUI with LangChain-Enabled AI Moves

This script creates a chess game where two AI agents (one playing White, one playing Black)
compete against each other. The chess logic is handled by python-chess and the graphical
interface is built using Tkinter. For move generation, we use LangChain to wrap the OpenAI
Chat API, providing the agent with a custom tool that prints the board state to the console.
This simulates giving the AI access to the console before deciding on its move.

Requirements:
    - python-chess
    - langchain
    - openai
    - tkinter (usually included with Python)

Installation (if needed):
    pip install python-chess langchain openai
